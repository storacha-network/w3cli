> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ùó w3cli and the underlying APIs are currently beta preview features
> Please read the beta Terms of Service ([web3.storage](https://console.web3.storage/terms), [NFT.Storage](https://console.nft.storage/terms)) for more details.
>
> Open an issue on the repo or reach out to the #web3-storage channel on [IPFS Discord](https://docs.ipfs.tech/community/chat/#discord) if you have any 
questions!

## Getting started 

Install the CLI from npm :

```console
npm install -g @web3-storage/w3cli
```

Authorize this agent to act on behalf of the account associated with your email address:

```console
w3 authorize alice@example.com
```

Create a new space for storing your data and register it:

```console
w3 space create Documents # pick a good name!
w3 space register
```

> By registering your w3up beta Space with either [NFT.Storage](http://nft.storage/) or [web3.storage](http://web3.storage/), you agree to the relevant w3up beta Terms of Service ([web3.storage](https://console.web3.storage/terms), [NFT.Storage](https://console.nft.storage/terms)). If you have an existing non-w3up beta account with NFT.Storage or web3.storage and register for the w3up beta version of the same product (NFT.Storage or web3.storage) using the same email, then at the end of the beta period, these accounts will be combined. Until the beta period is over and this migration occurs, uploads to w3up will not appear in your NFT.Storage or web3.storage account (and vice versa), even if you register with the same email.

Upload a file or directory:

```console
w3 up recipies.txt
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ùó __Public Data__ üåé: All data uploaded to w3up is available to anyone who requests it using the correct CID. Do not store any private or sensitive information in an unencrypted form using w3up.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ùó __Permanent Data__ ‚ôæÔ∏è: Removing files from w3up will remove them from the file listing for your account, but that doesn‚Äôt prevent nodes on the decentralized storage network from retaining copies of the data indefinitely. Do not use w3up for data that may need to be permanently deleted in the future.

---

### `w3 authorize <email>`

Authorize this agent to interact with the w3up service with any capabilities granted to the given email.

### `w3 up <path> [path...]`

Upload file(s) to web3.storage. The IPFS Content ID (CID) for your files is calculated on your machine, and sent up along with your files. web3.storage makes your content available on the IPFS network

* `--no-wrap` Don't wrap input files with a directory.
* `-H, --hidden` Include paths that start with ".".
* `-c, --car` File is a CAR file.
* `--shard-size` Shard uploads into CAR files of approximately this size in bytes.
* `--concurrent-requests` Send up to this many CAR shards concurrently.

### `w3 ls`

List all the uploads registered in the current space.

* `--json` Format as newline delimited JSON
* `--shards` Pretty print with shards in output

### `w3 rm <root-cid>`

Remove an upload from the uploads listing. Note that this command does not remove the data from the IPFS network, nor does it remove it from space storage (by default).

* `--shards` Also remove all shards referenced by the upload from the store. Use with caution and ensure other uploads do not reference the same shards.

### `w3 open <cid>`

Open a CID on https://w3s.link in your browser. You can also pass a CID and a path.

```bash
# opens a browser to https://w3s.link/ipfs/bafybeidluj5ub7okodgg5v6l4x3nytpivvcouuxgzuioa6vodg3xt2uqle
w3 open bafybeidluj5ub7okodgg5v6l4x3nytpivvcouuxgzuioa6vodg3xt2uqle

# opens a browser to https://w3s.link/ipfs/bafybeidluj5ub7okodgg5v6l4x3nytpivvcouuxgzuioa6vodg3xt2uqle/olizilla.png
w3 open bafybeidluj5ub7okodgg5v6l4x3nytpivvcouuxgzuioa6vodg3xt2uqle/olizilla.png
```

### `w3 whoami`

Print information about the current agent.

### `w3 space add <proof.ucan>`

Add a space to the agent. The proof is a CAR encoded delegation to _this_ agent.

### `w3 space create [name]`

Create a new w3 space with an optional name.

### `w3 space ls`

List spaces known to the agent.

### `w3 space register`

Register the space by adding a storage provider and delegating all of its 
capabilities to the currently authorized account. If you are authorized against
more than one account you'll need to pass the `--email` option to specify which account to
register the space with.

* `--email` The email address of the account to associate this space with.
* `--provider` The storage provider to associate with this space. The default is w3up web3.storage.
```
# to use w3up nft.storage as a storage provider instead of default did:web:web3.storage
w3 space register --provider did:web:nft.storage
```
> By registering your w3up beta Space with either [NFT.Storage](http://nft.storage/) or [web3.storage](http://web3.storage/), you agree to the relevant w3up beta Terms of Service ([web3.storage](https://console.web3.storage/terms), [NFT.Storage](https://console.nft.storage/terms)). If you have an existing non-w3up beta account with NFT.Storage or web3.storage and register for the w3up beta version of the same product (NFT.Storage or web3.storage) using the same email, then at the end of the beta period, these accounts will be combined. Until the beta period is over and this migration occurs, uploads to w3up will not appear in your NFT.Storage or web3.storage account (and vice versa), even if you register with the same email.

### `w3 space use <did>`

Set the current space in use by the agent.

### `w3 delegation create <audience-did>`

Create a delegation to the passed audience for the given abilities with the _current_ space as the resource.

* `--can` One or more abilities to delegate, default `*` (everything).
* `--name` Human readable name for the audience receiving the delegation.
* `--type` Type of the audience receiving the delegation, one of: device, app, service.
* `--output` Path of file to write the exported delegation data to.

### `w3 delegation ls`

List delegations created by this agent for others.

* `--json` Format as newline delimited JSON

### `w3 proof add <proof.ucan>`

Add a proof delegated to this agent. The proof is a CAR encoded delegation to _this_ agent. Note: you probably want to use `w3 space add` unless you know the delegation you received targets a resource _other_ than a w3 space.

### `w3 proof ls`

List proofs of delegated capabilities. Proofs are delegations with an audience matching the agent DID.

* `--json` Format as newline delimited JSON

### `w3 can space info <did>`

### `w3 can space recover <email>`

### `w3 can store add <car-path>`

Store a [CAR](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv1/) file to web3.storage.

### `w3 can store ls`

List CARs in the current space.

* `--json` Format as newline delimited JSON
* `--size` The desired number of results to return
* `--cursor` An opaque string included in a prior upload/list response that allows the service to provide the next "page" of results
* `--pre` If true, return the page of results preceding the cursor

### `w3 can store rm <car-cid>`

### `w3 can upload add <root-cid> <shard-cid> [shard-cid...]`

Register an upload - a DAG with the given root data CID that is stored in the given CAR shard(s), identified by CAR CIDs.

### `w3 can upload ls`

List uploads in the current space.

* `--json` Format as newline delimited JSON
* `--shards` Pretty print with shards in output
* `--size` The desired number of results to return
* `--cursor` An opaque string included in a prior upload/list response that allows the service to provide the next "page" of results
* `--pre` If true, return the page of results preceding the cursor

### `w3 can upload rm <root-cid>`

## FAQ

### Where are my keys and delegations stored?

In the system default user config directory:

- macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/w3access`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\w3access\Config` (for example, `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\w3access\Config`)
- Linux: `~/.config/w3access` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/w3access`)
